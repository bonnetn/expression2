Expression2 scripts
===================

## Purpose

These are various scripts that I made for the game Garry's mod.
They implement various algorithms that I liked.

## Scripts

### maze_mmaze

This script generate a maze with the given dimension and spawn props in game to
build it.

### acf_prediction

This script uses *Runge–Kutta methods* to simulate the trajectory of a bullet shot
by a cannon with a quadratic drag.


### suspension tester

This script takes a car, stimulate it, and then plot the Bode diagram of its
suspension. In order to do that, it uses *FFT*.
