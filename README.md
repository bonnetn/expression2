Expression2 scripts
===================

## Purpose

These are various scripts that I made for the game Garry's mod.
They implement various algorithms that I liked.

## Scripts

### maze_mmaze

This script generate a maze with the given dimension and spawn props in game to
build it.

### acf_prediction

This script uses *Runge–Kutta methods* to simulate the trajectory of a bullet shot
by a cannon with a quadratic drag.


### suspension tester

This script takes a car, stimulate it, and then plot the Bode diagram of its
suspension. In order to do that, it uses *FFT*.


### connect 4

This script is just a game of connect 4 with an elegant way to check for
solution in O(1).

### crypto

This is just a reimplementation of the *Diffie–Hellman key exchange* with
*exponentiation by squaring*.

### enigma

Just a unifinished attempt to reimplement *enigma* in game.

### mandelbrot fractal

Just an implementation of the *mandelbrot fractal*
